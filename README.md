You're wandering through the forest. You're lost in the dense thicket. There's a clearing. A wooden, cozy-looking cabin sits right in the centre. You can see some sort of faint glow through the window. Huh?

You enter. You find the source of the glow: a strange, alien machine in the corner of the main room. "...Hello? Hello?" No answer from anywhere in the cabin. The machine piques your curiosity, naturally. There are a few buttons. You hesitate for a few seconds. Your eyes are glued to them. "Here goes nothing."

The machine starts. You hear the whirr of its engine. Its eerie glow gets brighter. Yellow lights blink in some weird, cryptic sequence. Loud, organ-like notes bellow through a set of pipes at the top of the machine.
