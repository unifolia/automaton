          You're wandering through the forest. You're lost in the dense thicket.
          There's a clearing. A wooden, cozy-looking cabin sits right in the
          centre. You can see some sort of faint glow through the window. Huh?
        </p>
        <p>
          You enter. You find the source of the glow: a strange, alien machine
          in the corner of the main room. "...Hello? Hello?" No answer from
          anywhere in the cabin. The machine piques your curiosity, naturally.
          There are a few buttons. You hesitate for a few seconds. Your eyes are
          glued to them. "Here goes nothing..."
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine starts. You hear the whirr of its engine. Its eerie glow
          gets brighter. Yellow lights blink in some weird, cryptic sequence.
          Loud, organ-like notes bellow through a set of pipes at the top of the
          machine.

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>Version: 1.3.6</p>
        <p>
          This synthesizer's source code can be found here:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/unifolia/cellular-automaton-tastiera/tree/main"
            >GitHub</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how it all works - but the
          repository above contains all of the specifics.
        </p>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          This synthesizer was created using TypeScript. It uses the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API"
            >Web Audio API</a
          >
          to generate notes in the browser. It uses the aptly named
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API"
            >Web MIDI API</a
          >
          for receiving MIDI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because notes are generated in and via the browser, no audio files
          (.wav, .mp3, .ogg, etc.) are actually needed. The only file used is
          the reverb impulse response, which is wrapped around each note. The
          specific process is called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolution</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Frequency Calculations</h3>
        <p>
          Each of the grid's pads are given an ID from 1 to 64, respectively.
          This is in ascending order, so bottom left is 1 and top right is 64.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll use the first pad as an example. When that pad is pressed, its ID
          of 1 is passed into a note calculator function. Some transposition is
          needed so that the note is neither too low nor too high. The pad's ID
          is changed to equal
          <span>padId - row * 5 - 17</span>. The pad's <span>row</span> is
          defined as <span>Math.floor((padId - 1) / rowLen) + 1</span>, with
          <span>rowLen</span> being the square root of the grid size. In this
          case, <span>row</span> = 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this transposition, the first pad's ID is -19. So, why not just
          subtract 20 from every ID if they're going to increase in sequential
          order? This grid is not completely linear - like the grid of the
          Ableton Push that it was inspired by - so duplicate notes have to be
          taken into account. Each pad's final frequency is also defined by its
          row, rather than just its initial ID.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pad is close to its destination, but a couple of steps still have
          to be taken. First, it must be ensured that the notes fit into some
          sort of scale. A chromatic grid might sound fun, but it's largely
          useless. Some safety nets are required. There are multiple ways of
          interpreting it, but I chose the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_mode">Lydian mode</a> -
          or the notes <span>1 2 3 â™¯4 5 6 7</span>. Without getting too into the
          weeds, that is accomplished by once again changing the pad's ID - this
          time using
          <span>padId = padId + Math.floor(padId / 7 + 2) * 5 + X</span>, with
          <span>X</span> being some number between 0-5, depending on the initial
          IDs fit into the Lydian scale (a fancy modulo operation is used to
          ensure heptatonic compatibility). Don't forget your order of
          operations!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, that new ID (-26 in this case) is used to calculate the
          frequency relative to (or, semitones from) A440. The math is
          <span>frequency = +(440 * Math.pow(Math.pow(2, 1 / 12), padId))</span
          >. This gives us a frequency of 97.9989 Hz for the first pad - or, the
          note G2.

        <h3>Generation Logging</h3>
        <p>
          As Classic Mode is based on the rules of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
            >Conway's Game of Life</a
          >, it's possible to run into
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life_(cellular_automaton)"
            >still lifes</a
          >, which are unchanging clusters of notes. As the intention of this
          mode is to have growing, blooming, and ever-changing chords, the idea
          of the music devolving into the same notes repeating infinitely is...
          not ideal, at least for this application.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why there is constant <span>Generation Logging</span> happening
          in the background. With every generation comes a list of every active
          pad. If the current list is identical to the previous list (i.e. still
          life is happening), the game will reset itself.
          <span>Technically</span> this could happen in Random Mode as well. If
          it does happen, you will have witnessed the greatest statistical
          improbability of all time.
        </p>
        <h3>Reverb</h3>
        <p>
          When the app loads, the impulse response's .wav file is retrieved and
          turned into an array buffer. At the same time, an empty, generic
          convolver node is created globally. Once the synthesizer starts
          playing, every created note has its own reverb convolver created using
          a copy of the impulse response's decoded array buffer. The note's own
          convolver connects to its gain node, and the convolver/gain signal
          path gets plugged into the global convolver.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can think of the reverb/gain nodes as guitar pedals, and the
          global convolver node as an amp with multiple inputs. In this
          scenario, a copy of the reverb has to be "installed" onto the pedal.
          As this pedal doesn't understand .wav files, an array buffer is used
          instead (which is effectively that .wav file as 1s and 0s). Once
          complete, the pedals get plugged into the amp. This process happens
          for every single note!
